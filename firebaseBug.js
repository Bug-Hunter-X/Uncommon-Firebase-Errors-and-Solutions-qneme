The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the database rules are too restrictive or incorrectly configured.  For instance, if you're trying to read data that your security rules don't permit, you'll get a permission denied error. Another common issue is improperly structured data, leading to unexpected behavior.  Incorrect data types or missing fields will throw errors.  Asynchronous operations in Firebase are also a source of problems. If you don't handle promises and callbacks correctly, you might encounter unexpected behavior or unhandled errors.  Finally, ensure proper error handling is in place to gracefully manage potential issues.
